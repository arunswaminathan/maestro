maestro
=======

The purpose of this project is to build a declarative programming language, named Maestro, for users to easily express units of computations (a.k.a. jobs) and their dependencies. The runtime then distributes the jobs and ensures an order that doesnâ€™t conflict with expressed dependencies.
